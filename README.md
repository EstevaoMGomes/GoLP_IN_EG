# Plasma Data Analysis with PySR

## Overview
This repository contains code and documentation for a project conducted during an internship at the [Group of Lasers and Plasmas (GoLP)](https://golp.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/) at [Instituto Superior Técnico](https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/). The project focuses on analyzing plasma data using [PySR](https://github.com/MilesCranmer/PySR), a Python library for symbolic regression, to uncover underlying physical relationships in the data.

## Project Description
The goal of this project was to apply symbolic regression techniques to plasma datasets, identifying mathematical expressions that describe the behavior of plasma systems. PySR was used to process experimental or simulated data, providing interpretable models that could offer insights into plasma physics phenomena.

### Key Objectives
- Create artifitial data and process plasma data for analysis.
- Use PySR to perform symbolic regression and derive analytical expressions.
- Validate the resulting models against known physical principles or experimental results.
- Document findings and provide reproducible code for future research.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/EstevaoMGomes/GoLP_IN_EG.git
   cd GoLP_IN_EG
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

Ensure PySR is installed and configured properly (refer to its documentation for setup instructions).

## Usage

For custom analysis, you can create your own analysis file by using the example ```gaussian_analysis.py``` as a template. For instance, adapt gaussian_analysis.py to fit your plasma data characteristics, then test PySR by running:
```bash
python src/gaussian_analysis.py 
```

This allows you to experiment with PySR’s settings (e.g., operators, complexity) and tailor the regression to your specific research questions.


## Results
The symbolic regression models generated by PySR are stored in results/. Key findings include [briefly summarize a key result, e.g., "a simplified expression for plasma density as a function of temperature"]. Plots and logs provide visual and numerical validation of the models.
